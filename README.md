# hello-world
learning by doing
Hi everyone!
I am a naval architect, international maritime regulations and dynamic positioning specialist
I became quite interested in autonomous vessels using AI systems and at this time it is my new hobby
I feel comfortable with C but still a rookie with python 
It would be great to exchange ideas and alternative solutions with you githubbers!
